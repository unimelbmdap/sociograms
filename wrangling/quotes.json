    "Quote":"I think it was maybe when I was younger there was a bit of a culture of... after a trip I would go on, there would then be an album that would be uploaded to social media of that trip, which I liked then and still kind of like now, looking back through them. But then there were a couple of trips where that didn't happen, I think just because the friends I was with weren\u2019t big sharers on social media anyway. And then it just sort-of dropped out of the thought process. Maybe because of the stuff I was doing I'd been doing for years by that point and I didn't feel like I needed to share it as much. Early on in my outdoor adventuring days, I was pretty keen on letting the world know how rad I was [laughs]. Also, I wasn't doing stuff that was as impressive as when I was younger either. Yeah, it didn't feel as remarkable. And yeah, probably also just the friends I was with, it wasn't as much of a thing. And then it just sort-of faded into nothing. And then there did come a point, especially when my daughter came along, where it sort-of became a conscious decision, as opposed to just being lazy.",
