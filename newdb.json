So, if I see something that is a bit weird or is strangely worded, I\u2019ll take a photo of it. (...) I don\u2019t even really post that many stereotypical happy snaps of people. And never landscape photos, they don\u2019t interest me at all, like photos of a landmark. I just feel like I\u2019m not a very good photographer and no-one cares to see my amateur photo of something when they can get a very professional photo of that by Googling. Like say I\u2019m at Mt Fuji, you don\u2019t need to see my crap photo of it from 200 metres away on an iPhone camera when you can just look at a better one. That\u2019s why I\u2019d rather just take photos of things that I find funny. ",
