So it's a good way of staying in contact. Also the Stories function, you can have private stories. So I've got stories with five of my closest friends. And then if something funny has happened or whatever, I can just post it on that. So I know that just those friends are seeing it. And then there's Snapchat memories as well, if I take a photo on Snapchat, I can store it on there. And I've got photos all the way back to 2016, when I first got Snapchat. ",

But mainly it's posting photos, looking at other people's photos, I follow a few news accounts and stuff as well. So I use that more for where I get my first source of news, like ABC News and stuff. Instagram is a bit wider I think. (...) I think a story post is probably more something to show people where I am. Or just a photo of my friends or something. Whereas like a grid post probably is more of a photo of me somewhere that isn't Melbourne usually. Or like a photo that I think people wouldn't commonly see on Stories as much. Like, I just came back from India. I'll probably post some photos from there, but probably would not post on my story, because I want to have that on my account for longer so people can see it.",

And then going down to the family WhatsApp group, it's all of the highlights. And then I suppose below that would be what I would consider sharing on social media, which so far has been nothing, and I haven't ruled it out completely. We've thought about doing Instagram stories to a close friends group. So I've actually made a group \u2013 I've gone through and made the group, I just haven't put anything on there yet. So that would be stuff that would be further down the priority list that would then go out to that, that would be a curation of the curation.",
